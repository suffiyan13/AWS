 STEPS TO CREATE A VPC in AWS:

1. Create a VPC
Step 1: Go to the VPC Dashboard and choose Create VPC.
Step 2: Select VPC only.
Step 3: Provide the CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16), then click Create.

2. Enable DNS Features
Step 1: After creating the VPC, go to VPC Actions.
Step 2: Tick the options:
Enable DNS resolution.
Enable DNS hostnames.
Step 3: Save changes.

3. Create Subnets in Different Availability Zones
Step 1: Choose the VPC you created earlier.
Step 2: Click Create Subnet.
Step 3: Assign the subnets to different Availability Zones.
Step 4: Make sure the IPv4 CIDR block for each subnet falls under the VPC CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24).

4. Create an Internet Gateway (IGW)
Step 1: Go to Internet Gateways and click Create IGW.
Step 2: Attach the IGW to your VPC to enable internet access.

5. Set Up Route Tables
Step 1: Go to Route Tables and select the VPC.
Step 2: Add a route to allow traffic (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0 for internet access).
Step 3: Associate the subnets to this route table.
Step 4: Ensure only trusted sources have access by configuring the routing and security rules.

Helpful Tool:
Use the (https://jodies.de/ipcalc) IP Calculator to calculate and verify your CIDR ranges.

This simple guide should help you create a VPC with subnets, enable DNS features, and set up internet access securely!
